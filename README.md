# mobcord

Discord client for mobile linux

## Installation

### As a standalone app

```sh
cargo run
```

TODO: make installation instruction

### As userscript

Webkit2gtk can be quite slow on some devices, so it fine to install the mobcord patches as userscript to your normal browser.
To do that, download src/script.js and add it to your userscript manager.
